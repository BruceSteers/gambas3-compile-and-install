This is a script to help ensure the fantastic Gambas3 basic latest version can be compiled
and installed on various linux disrtros it supports.

Version 3.0\
Written by Bruce steers <g3compiler@bws.org.uk>\
Note. This script is not written by any of the gambas team members just a Gambas user/supporter.\
So please do not contact them for support if you have problems with running this script. Thank you.

<pre>
Intention/Introduction:
Compiling and installing Gambas3 from source can be a bit tricky if you do not have all
the correct software and dependencies you need installed first.

There is installation info on the Gambas wiki website giving a list of required packages for 
each distro but it is not auto-created and needs updating at times as things change.
Whilst trying to get the Gambas wiki pages for Debian and Raspbian up to date I asked on the 
developers mailing list for some "expert" advice. 
I was told by the main Gambas developer Beno√Æt Minisini of a file that exists in the GitLab 
repository called ".gitlab-ci.yml" that is used by GitLab itself to compile Gambas for distibution. 
This file contains up to date lists of package requirements for various systems.

With this new knowledge I have made 2 shell scripts that does the following...
</pre>

+ Offers to download/clone the latest Gambas3 or lets you select an existing folder.
+ Download can use git to clone, or curl to download archive and unzip.
+ Offers to install ALL dependencies/packages needed for compilation/install.
+ Checks if any new dependencies/packages have been added.
+ Offers yes or no options to run all commands needed to compile/install Gambas3
   from the './reconf-all' to the 'make install' or "yes to all" can be selected to 
   fully automate the process.
+ Sudo password timeout can be temporarily raised while running so you don't have to stay 
  and watch in order to catch the password request at 'make install'.
+ Offers to make a desktop icon and/or a menu item.

Supports..
+ Ubuntu, 
+ LinuxMint, 
+ Debian, 
+ Raspbian, 
+ Archlinux, 
+ ManjaroLinux

- Alpine (untested and unsupported, I do not reccomend using it on an Alpine system)


How to use...

Simply put...
Run it from terminal, follow the instructions.

Firstly run 'gambas3-download-and-install-dependencies'
This to download (if you have not already) the latest beta or stable versions using 
'git clone' or 'curl' to download an archive and unpack it to a folder or selecting an existing folder.
Also this is for installing ALL dependency packages required to compile gambas.

Then run 'gambas3-update-compile-and-install'
This gives you options to select what part of the compiling proccesses you want to do
and has an update mode that will check for updates using git and only re-compile if updates were found.

----------------------------

Full explanation / instructions.


Run this Script from terminal.
Either place the script in an already existing Gambas3 Gitlab clone folder and run 
it from there or it will ask to either use git to clone the gambas dir to the current 
dir or download the zip archive using curl and unpack or you can select an existing 
downloaded dir on your disk.
If downloading a new clone you are asked for a path/name for the download folder
or it defaults to 'gambas' in the current dir.

By default the script tries to detect the linux version you are running. If that's not 
working it gives a list of supported linux types to choose from.

Supported variations are...
Ubuntu/Mint (various versions), Debian (various versions), Raspbian, Archlinux, Manjaro

Note. if you are using Archlinux-clang you may need to set manually as i do not know how to 
differntiate between archlinux and archlinux-clang


Once your linux is detected if not run from the Gambas source folder you are asked to 
select an existing dir on first run then this directory path is saved.

Note. if your Gambas source folder is not a GitLab clone it may be missing the vital 
".gitlab-ci.yml" file.
To fix this go to https://gitlab.com/gambas/gambas/-/blob/master/.gitlab-ci.yml
and download the .gitlab-ci.yml file and copy it to your Gambas source directory.

You are then presented with an options page where you can set how you want to compile.
ALL procedures can be run or you can select what ones you want.

You can asked a series of questions to give a y/n/a answer before each command is run.
y = YES, n = NO (default if no answer given) , a = Ask no more and say Yes to All
You can abort at any time pressing Ctrl-C.
The commands come in the following order...

** "Run dependency install?" 
For the initial setup script
 Installs ALL packages/dependencies needed to compile Gambas3.
For the compiler script.
 Checks if any new dependencies have been added and offers to install if so.

** "Run './reconf-all' ?" 
 Sets up the compiling environment, needed first time, or to update environment.

** "Run './configure' (y for yes, v for verbose error messages only) ?"
 Configures all the source code ready for compilation.
 (./configere produces a lot of output text making error messages hard to find,
 type 'v' to only show the error messages not the rest of the output.)
 
** "Run 'make' ?"
 Compiles ALL source code ready for installation.

** "Run 'make install' ?"
 Installs Gambas into the System.

 IMPORTANT: if you already have Gambas3 on your system either installed by using your 
  package manager to install the distro's default version or via adding the PPA then
  it MUST be completely removed **first** or you will get conflicts.
  The script detects a packager installed Gambas3 and warns you that before 'make install' 
  is run it will remove the old installation for you.
  After installing from compilation Gambas3 will not show as installed by your
  package manager.


** "Install a desktop launcher?"
** "Install a menu launcher?"

(Icon/Launcher installation uses xdg)

A log file /home/username/gambas-compile-install.log is saved holding all the information about
commands run in the script. This was added at the request of the gambas developers so they can ask you
for the output message record if you are getting errors.

Note...
The Gambas team are very busy and did not make this script so if you
have problems please contact me about it and not them.

Unless you have problems occuring during the running of the commands 
./reconf-all 
./configure 
'make' 
'make install'

Everything else outside of those commands is for me to resolve :)
Thank you
